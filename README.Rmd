# praiseme

The goal of praiseme is to figure out what the hell I'm doing and now with glue! but it's not happening...

## Installation

You can install the released version of praiseme from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("praiseme")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem, which I still don't understand

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
